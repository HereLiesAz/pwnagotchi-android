# Testing

This document describes the testing strategy for the Pwnagotchi Android Super App.

As the project is in its early stages, a formal testing suite has not yet been established. However, the following testing strategies are planned for the future:

## Unit Tests

Unit tests will be used to test individual components of the application in isolation. They will be written using the JUnit and Mockito frameworks.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests will be used to test the interaction between different components of the application. They will be written using the Espresso and UI Automator frameworks.

## End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests will be used to test the entire application from start to finish. They will be written using the Appium framework.

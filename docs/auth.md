# Authentication and Authorization

This document describes the authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Pwnagotchi Android application.

Currently, the application does not have any authentication or authorization mechanisms. The WebSocket server is open and does not require any authentication. This is a potential security risk and should be addressed in the future.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement a token-based authentication system for the WebSocket server.
*   Add support for user accounts and roles.

# UI/UX Design

This document outlines the UI/UX design principles and guidelines for the Pwnagotchi Android Super App.

## Principles

*   **Simplicity:** The UI should be clean, intuitive, and easy to use.
*   **Consistency:** The UI should be consistent across all screens.
*   **Readability:** The UI should be easy to read and understand.
*   **Accessibility:** The UI should be accessible to all users.

## Modes

The app will have two distinct modes, and the UI will adapt to each mode.

### Client Mode

In Client Mode, the UI will focus on displaying data from the external Pwnagotchi device. It will provide a clear and concise overview of the device's status and activity.

### Native Mode

In Native Mode, the UI will provide a more immersive experience, as the Android device itself is the Pwnagotchi. The UI will display the Pwnagotchi's "face" and other status information, similar to the original e-ink display.

# Performance

This document provides information about the performance of the Pwnagotchi Android application.

The application is designed to be lightweight and efficient. The WebSocket connection is managed in a background service to avoid blocking the main thread. The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, which is a modern and efficient UI toolkit.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement a caching mechanism to reduce network requests.
*   Optimize the UI for better performance.

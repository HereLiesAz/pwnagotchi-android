# pwnagotchi On Android

This project's goal is to create the ultimate Android application for Pwnagotchi enthusiasts. It is a "Super App" that can operate in two distinct modes, providing a comprehensive mobile solution for both interacting with and *becoming* a Pwnagotchi.

## Project Goals

This application has two primary modes of operation:

### 1. Client Mode (Companion App)
In this mode, the app acts as a feature-rich client and control panel for an external Pwnagotchi device (like a Raspberry Pi). This allows you to monitor and manage your Pwnagotchi from your phone. Features include:
-   **Live Status Dashboard:** A real-time view of your Pwnagotchi's mood, status, and activity.
-   **Handshake & Plugin Management:** View captured handshakes and manage the plugins on your device.
-   **Notifications:** Receive alerts for important events, like when a new handshake is captured.
-   **oPwngrid Integration:** Connect to the community and view leaderboards and stats.

### 2. Native Mode (Android as Pwnagotchi)
In this mode, the app aims to turn a compatible, rooted Android device *into* a Pwnagotchi. This leverages the phone's own hardware to run the core Pwnagotchi functionalities natively.
-   **WiFi Monitor Mode:** Utilizes the device's WiFi chipset to scan for networks.
-   **Native `bettercap`:** Runs the `bettercap` toolset directly on Android to perform WiFi scanning and handshake capture.
-   **Full Pwnagotchi Experience:** Emulates the complete Pwnagotchi experience, including the character engine, UI, and background operation, all on your phone.

**This is a work in progress and is not yet fully functional in either mode.**

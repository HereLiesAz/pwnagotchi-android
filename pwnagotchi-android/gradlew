# A script for executing Gradle builds, that first automatically downloads and
# installs the appropriate Gradle distribution.
#
# You can normally just use this script in place of the `gradle` command.
# For example, `gradlew build` runs the `build` task.
#
# You can also set the following environment variables:
#
# - `GRADLE_HOME` - the path to a Gradle installation. If set, this script
#   will use it instead of downloading a new distribution.
#
# - `GRADLE_OPTS` - the command-line options to pass to the `java` command
#   when running Gradle.
#
# - `JAVA_HOME` - the path to a Java installation. If set, this script will
#   use it to run Gradle.
#

#
# Set `-e` so that this script will fail if any of the commands fail.
#
set -e

#
# Resolve the location of the `java` command.
